This site is a snapshot of a few personal projects on GitHub; some useful, some not.  A few of my more interesting sites are...

<!--more-->

**Personal Blog [http://fredlackey.com](http://fredlackey.com)**  
There's everything in this one.  From random thoughts or hhelpful info to just complete babble.

**RESTUtils [http://restutils.com](http://restutils.com)**  
Info on a cool utility I created which allows developers to standup a complete API without typig any code.  Or, if you want your own custom API, you can write a simple JavaScript file with normal function calls and methods.  RESTUtils will handle everything else.

**CICD.sh [http://cicd.sh](http://cicd.sh)**  
This one was more of a teaching exercise for Terraform, 12 Factor patterns, and CICD.  The goal was to remove the mystery from all of them by creating a full CICD process with a single BASH script.  The Terraform examples are also follow a single-page approach (no modules).
